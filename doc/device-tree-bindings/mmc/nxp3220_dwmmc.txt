* Nexell NXP3220 DWC_mobile_storage

The Nexell provides DWC_mobile_storage interface which supports
. Embedded Multimedia Cards (EMMC-version 4.5)
. Secure Digital memory (SD mem-version 3.0)
. Secure Digital I/O (SDIO-version 3.0)

The Nexell NXP3220 DWC_mobile_storage provides 3 channels.
SOC specific and Board specific properties are channel specific.

Required SoC Specific Properties:

- compatible: should be
	- nexell,nxp3220-dwmmc: for Nexell nxp3220 platforms

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
	region.
- index: physical chanell index.

Required Board Specific Properties:

- #address-cells: should be 1.
- #size-cells: should be 0.
- nexel,bus-width: The width of the bus used to interface the devices
	supported by DWC_mobile_storage (SD-MMC/EMMC/SDIO).
	. Typically the bus width is 4 or 8.
	. 8bit width support only ch2.
- nexell,drive_shift: Output drive clock phase shift. range is 0 ~ 7
- nexell,sample_shift: Read sample clock phase shitf. range is 0 ~ 7.
- frequency: sdmmc clock frequency, typically 50MHz
- nexell,ddr: use ddr transfer mode, support only ch0, 8bit bus width.

Example:

mmc0: mmc@26080000 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "nexell,nexell-dwmmc";
	reg = <0x26080000 0x1000>;
	nexell,bus-width = <4>;
	index = <0>;
	status = "disabled";
};

&mmc0 {
	frequency = <50000000>;
	exell,drive_shift = <0x03>;
	nexell,sample_shift = <0x02>;
	status = "okay";
};
