 - ehci,vbus-gpio: gpio for USB HOST vbus enable pin
 - phy-supply: supply for USB phy

Example:

	usb2phy: usb2phy@24030000 {
		compatible = "nexell,nxp3220-usb2-phy";
		reg = <0x24030000 0x200>;
		#phy-cells = <1>;
		clocks = <&clock_usb USB_0_AHB_CLK>,
		         <&clock_usb SYSREG_USB_0_APB_CLK>;
		clock-names = "ahb", "apb";
		status = "disabled";
